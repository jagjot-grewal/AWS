REGIONS

AWS regions are the physical locations around the world where data centers are clustered. The group of logical data centers are called Availability zones. 
Each Region consist of minimum of 3 Availability zones (AZs) which are isolated from each other. 
AWS maintains multiple geographic Regions, including Regions in North America, South America, Europe, China, Asia Pacific, South Africa, and the Middle East.

Availability Zones (AZs)

AZ is a group of logical data centers present in a region. Each AZ has independent power, cooling, and physical security and is connected via redundant, ultra-low-latency networks.
All AZs in an AWS Region are interconnected with high-bandwidth, low-latency networking. 
All traffic between AZs is encrypted.
AWS customers focused on high availability can design their applications to run in multiple AZs to achieve even greater fault-tolerance.
AZs are physically separated by a meaningful distance, many kilometers, from any other AZ, although all are within 100 km (60 miles) of each other.

Note: Currently there are 32 regions and 102 Availability zones.

question: what is the purpose of having 3 AZ in each region?
answer: Multiple AZs provide high availability so, if one AZ becomes down for some reason, the other AZ provide the service.
